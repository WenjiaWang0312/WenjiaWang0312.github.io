    (Translated with GPT4)<br>
In the war-torn ruins of his home, Adam lives alone with his daughter Amelia. His wife had died in a merciless bombing, leaving Adam with endless grief and responsibility. Amelia suffers from a severe illness, and Adam searches the ruins daily for food and medicine, striving to sustain his daughter's life.

His brother once visited, a shrewd businessman, who suggested using the "humanitarian corridor" opened by the military to evacuate Amelia from the city. This green corridor, designed for families with children, seemed to be their only hope. However, Adam realized that his daughter's frail body could not withstand the journey's hardships, and he angrily rejected his brother's proposal, driving him away. Days of continuous toil and despair exhausted Adam, and he eventually collapsed on a gloomy afternoon. When he awoke, he discovered that Amelia was gone, and a surge of panic overwhelmed him. Suspecting his brother had taken her, he immediately went to his brother's pharmacy, only to find his brother's cold body. In despair, he found some clues in the pharmacy that led him to a bombed-out school. There, he bribed a vagrant with the little food he had, learning that Amelia might have been taken to a hospital. Adam rushed to the hospital, frantic, and found his daughter's name on the patient list. However, the guard told him that the informed doctor had been taken by the military for interrogation at a toy store. As an ordinary but desperate father, Adam unhesitatingly went to the toy store. He stabbed three armed soldiers with a dagger, successfully freeing the imprisoned doctor. The doctor told him that Amelia had been taken to the old church, where the so-called humanitarian corridor was also located.

With hope of seeing his daughter again, Adam proceeded to the old church, heavy yet determined. However, upon arriving, his heart was torn apart by despair. Before him lay a tragic scene, the ground covered with the executed bodies of civilians, the so-called corridor nothing but a cruel lie. Adam staggered to the backyard of the old church, his mind in turmoil, gradually recalling the heartbreaking truth—Amelia had already died from her illness, and after seeking medical help in vain, her body was buried in the garden in the backyard. The consecutive losses of his wife and daughter were unbearable for Adam, causing him to suffer from short-term amnesia. During this time, his survival in the ruins, his search for his daughter, and even his lone assassination of soldiers were all illusions supported by his inner thoughts.

Now, facing the harsh reality, he finally understood that it all was just a manifestation of his deep longing for what he had lost and his refusal to accept the grief. Adam knelt in the garden's soil, tears silently streaming down, finally reconciling with his inner demons and accepting the irrevocable losses brought by the war.

<h5>玩冰汽时代这个游戏时，民众们在极端寒冷的天气下总是对我这个领导者提出各种刁难的要求，包括要求美食、医疗、住房等不断提升的需求。然而当我为了渡过极端情况而实行铁腕统治，树立绝对个人崇拜之后，狂热的民众会开始互相揭发，有一点质疑声立刻被抨击为异端分子。起初我很满意自己的政策可以排除质疑，顺利推行，不需要再照顾所有人的感受。但是后来狂热的人们建立了“刑场”，每天必须吊死一个“忠诚不绝对”的人，让我都觉得有些过火，因为我并不希望有任何人死亡。好在我最后在刑场建立的第二天通关，只牺牲了一个有质疑声的可怜工程师。</h5>
